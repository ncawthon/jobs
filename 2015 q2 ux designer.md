# UX/UI designer

We have a website. It's really big, and quite pretty these days. Under the hood, we rebuilt it completely, launching that new version back in April, when we introduced private modules. But we're just getting started.

[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) gets a million unique visitors every month and over 5MM pageviews, and has grown 200% in the last 12 months. People use it to find new modules, to read the documentation, and now they use it to manage their private modules as well.

In the near future we're going to launch our Organizations feature, and our users will be able to manage teams and package permissions from the website too. Soon after that we're going to be adding a bunch of new features to make it faster and easier to find the right package, by adding [curation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#collections) and [programmatic validation](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/94662089625/the-future-of-the-npm-website-lets-map-this#ecosystems) of packages, both of which will give us the new data we need to enhance the all-important search experience.

These are chunky, challenging features, and we need somebody to help us design the best experience for our users. npm's philosophy is to reduce friction, and a user experience that is complimentary to the workflow of someone who spends their day in a CLI. These might include the usage of smart defaults, sentient states, and acknowledgement of a keyboard-based approach to navigation. Somebody who understands developers and has worked on technical products before is going to be at an advantage. 

To facilitate this continued understanding of a frictionless workflow, we will be relying on you to introduce a scalable user research component to our product cycles. We want you to champion and evangelize the unbiased, candid voice of the developer as we continue to improve our upon our product features. We know that some of our design decisions are (were) flawed, and need you to remind us - through the user's voice - of what fixes are still outstanding and where to implore change within our own work. 

Within Design, UX and UI are different skill sets and different jobs, and we know we're asking for a lot when we say we want both. With all other things being equal we will lean towards people who are stronger UX designers, and are stronger in the concept phase of product development. However, from a production standpoint - if there's more UI work than you can handle, we'll empower you to hire contractors. You will be responsible for managing the consistency of their visual language, our relationship with them and ultimately approving their work. In time, we'll help you build a team of interaction designers, user researchers and UI engineers, growing your department as npm grows as well.

We are *not* asking you to also be a developer: while you will be part of the engineering organization — because we believe design and engineering should collaborate closely — basic engineering skills are not a requirement of this job. However, the authoring and maintaining of interactive style guides, building of objectified SCSS/LESS frameworks for which new features can be easily referenced, or converting of all images to a single SVG sprite (speeding up page loads / reducing server requests) - these will all help the UI designer influence and improve the visual direction of the front end application. 

This position will be based in our offices in lovely downtown Oakland, CA, and we are not looking for remote candidates for this position.
